This project is a implementation of ParCEL algorithms - class expression learning algorithms for Description Logic.

Including:
1. ParCEL
2. ParCEL-Ex
3. Modification version of DL-Learner (mainly on Validation classes for evaluation purpose - compare with ParCEL algorithms)
4. Implementation of the Fortification strategy
